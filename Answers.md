1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a library that makes javascript a lot easier and a lot more fun by compiling millions of components for you. It saves you the hassle of writing vanilla javascript that would take 5 times as long.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

It means that you are thinking in the current state, without having to dig back to vanilla to solve problematic functions, or to the CSS to style in a less civilized way.

1. Describe state.

State is the parts of React that can change. Each component can mantain its own state.

1. Describe props.

Props is the shortened word for "properties" that each component holds and uses. Props can be passed in uni-directional flows.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Anything that is affecting the inside of the scope of the current function from the outside.
